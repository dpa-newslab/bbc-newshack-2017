We had some great tools in mind that can be used with Elasticsearch - some of them are used for prototypes at the dpa newslab, like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Facetview](https://github.com/okfn/facetview). 

Due to the restrictions for the #newsHack, none of those tools could be used right off the bat. The hackathon organizers were open to lifting the restrictions as we asked, but it was not possible. Or suggestion to hackathon organizers would be to think very hard about this and see why these restrictions are necessary in the first place, and if there is a way around this. Why? Because as a coding journalist, my first impulse is not to code, but to look around for tools that can be plugged together to explore data.

Have a look at the [tools list](tools/) if you want to explore this further.
