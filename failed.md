**We worked against the briefing** We had some great tools in mind that can be used with Elasticsearch - some of them are used for prototypes at the dpa newslab. We've put together a [tools list](tools/) if you are interested. 

Due to the restrictions for the #newsHack, none of those tools could be used. **We [tried](post-to-get/) anyway**. Our bad.

Our hosts were very open to lifting the restrictions as soon as we asked them - but it was not possible to do that during the hackathon.
