**We worked against the briefing** We had some great tools in mind that can be used with Elasticsearch - some of them are used for prototypes at the dpa newslab, like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Facetview](https://github.com/okfn/facetview).

Due to the restrictions for the #newsHack, none of those tools could be used. **We tried anyway**.

Our hosts were open to lifting the restrictions, but it was not possible. 

Have a look at the [tools list](tools/) if you want to explore this further or would like to know how an Elasticsearch index can be configured to work with those tools.
